### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Timur â€” a senior software engineer at [EPAM Systems](https://www.epam.com/). I'm Web Developer for more than 10 years. Programming is my passion. 

My keen eye for detail allows me to create complex compositions with ease and finesse in PHP. I know the ins and outs of the WordPress platform like the back of my hand, and I am capable of crafting custom themes and plugins that are both functional and beautiful.

With my coding skills and attention to detail, I'll work tirelessly to turn your ideas into a stunning reality. From custom WordPress themes and plugins to complex PHP solutions, I have the expertise to make it happen. 

Iâ€™m the creator and owner of one of the most popular sites about WordPress: https://wp-kama.ru.
